# Challenge #3 - due sep 17, 2023

This challenge will get your team started using branching in git, and using a pull request approval process.

## Instructions

Use the trunk-based strategy outlined in the course notes to create a file called `teamProfiles.md` in your team's 
challenge 3 repository. Use your MUN id for the name of your branch and make sure it appears in the remote repo
and is added to the trunk via an appropriate pull request.  Your contribution to the file is to add the profile table
you created for challenge 1. All the team profiles should be added to the one file.

In the class session on Thursday Sep 14, your team should decide on a process to respond to pull requests for 
this challenge. 
Due to the short time frame for this challenge, you may select one team member to approve pull requests, so it can 
happen quickly. You do not need a team review of the request in your approval process for this challenge.

Also nominate a "note-taker" at the beginning of the team meeting on Thursday to complete the meeting notes entry in
the repository. The only agenda items for the meeting are the nominate the note-taker and determine the request response
process for this challenge.  The note-taker records team decisions in the `meetingNotes.md` file and submits it to the 
trunk with a pull request.
Modify markdown file "profile.md" to create a personal profile which will introduce you to your project team.
This should profile the relevant skills you currently have for the course project, and what relevant 
skills you are interested in leaning for the course project.

## Submission

Your grade will be based on your branch and pull requests.

Submit by pushing your branch to the remote team repo with a pull request. The team request response process should be
completed by the deadline.
